# Basic Slot Game Code Base - SodaSplash
SodaSplash is a basic slot game that demonstrates the core functionalities of a slot machine, including spinning reels, stopping logic, and win evaluation. The game is built using PixiJS, a fast 2D rendering engine that uses WebGL, making it highly performant and suitable for interactive graphics applications.

## Development and Customization
In this project, you can manage components and renderer settings based on PixiJS's WebGL renderer. The core Pixi code base is located in the src/core directory. This project was developed in 2018-2019, and it does not use module bundler like Webpack or Vite and is written in ES5. I recommend adapting it to the latest technology or using it as an example to learn PixiJS.

This project will make it easier for those new to PixiJS to get started, and it provides valuable insights into essential steps like spinning and winning for those looking to develop a slot game.

Feel free to develop and customize the project as you wish. Although I am not actively working on this project, do not hesitate to reach out if you need any help. We hope it proves useful and helps you in your projects.
